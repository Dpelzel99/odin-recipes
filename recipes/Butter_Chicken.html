    <h1>Description</h1>
    <h4>This recipe is one of my all time favorites. It is simple to make, especially when you have the simmer sauce in a jar...
        But one thing that makes this meal perfect is making sure you make the rice perfect as well.
        Some Naan bread and cilantro also add to the dish nicely.
